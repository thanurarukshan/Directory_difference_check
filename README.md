# diff_pro

  

## Overview

  

This project includes shell scripts for comparing the contents, permissions, and ownership of files between two directories or files. It generates a detailed comparison report, highlighting any differences in file content, permissions, ownership, and missing files. If symbolic links are present, the scripts follow these links and compare the target files.

  

## Versions

  

### diff_pro.sh

  

This original script compares directories and generates a comparison report, displaying differences in file content, permissions, ownership, and missing files.

  

### diff_pro_v2.0.sh

  

An improved version of the original script, adding configurable options through runtime prompts to allow users to select specific checks (permissions, ownership, content).

  

### diff_pro_v3.0.sh

  

The latest version, `diff_pro_v3.0.sh`, adds advanced functionality, allowing users to run the script directly from the command line with flags for ease of use.

  

## Features

  

-  **File Content Comparison**: Compares the contents of files and displays differences side by side.

-  **Permission and Ownership Check**: Checks for differences in file permissions and ownership between matching files.

-  **Configurable Options**:

-  `diff_pro_v2.0.sh` uses runtime prompts for selection.

-  `diff_pro_v3.0.sh` allows configuration with command-line flags.

-  **Missing File Detection**: Identifies files present in one directory but missing in the other.

-  **Symbolic Link Resolution**: Follows symbolic links in both directories and compares the target files.

-  **Formatted CLI Output**: Uses colors to make output easy to interpret.

-  **Report Generation**: Saves all comparison results to a customizable report file.

  

## Prerequisites

  

Ensure that both paths (files or directories) exist and are accessible.

  

## Steps to Use

  

### Make the Script Executable

  

Run the following command to make `diff_pro_v3.0.sh` executable:

  

```bash

chmod  +x  diff_pro_v3.0.sh
```
  

##Move  to  PATH (Optional)

For  easier  access,  you  can  move  the  script  to  a  directory  in  your  PATH,  allowing  it  to  be  run  from  anywhere.  For  example:

  

bash
```bash
sudo  mv  diff_pro_v3.0.sh  /usr/local/bin/diff-pro
```
Once  moved,  you  can  run  the  script  simply  by  typing  diff-pro  from  any  terminal.

  

Usage

Running  the  Script

To  compare  directories  or  files,  use  the  following  syntax:

  

bash
```bash
diff-pro  /path/to/dir/or/file  /path/to/dir2/or/file2  --report-name  "report_name"  -p  -o  -c
```
Flags

```-p```:  Check  for  permission  differences.

```-o```:  Check  for  ownership  differences.

```-c```:  Check  for  content  differences.

```--report-name```:  Specifies  the  name  of  the  report  file (e.g., "report"  will  save  the  report  as  report.txt).

Example  Usage

bash
```bash
diff-pro  /path/to/first/dir  /path/to/second/dir  --report-name  "my_comparison"  -p  -o  -c
```
This  command  compares  the  contents,  permissions,  and  ownership  of  files  in  both  directories  and  saves  the  report  as  my_comparison.txt.

You  can  also  use  the  script  for  comparing  individual  files:

  

bash
```bash
diff-pro  /path/to/file1.txt  /path/to/file2.txt  --report-name  "file_comparison"  -p  -o  -c
```
This  will  compare  the  files  and  save  the  report  as  file_comparison.txt.

  

Legacy  Usage

For  diff_pro.sh  and  diff_pro_v2.0.sh,  you  can  manually  set  the  directories  and  options  inside  the  script  or  follow  the  prompts  when  running.

  

Example  Usage  for  diff_pro_v2.0.sh

To  run  diff_pro_v2.0.sh  with  prompts:

  

bash

```bash
sh  diff_pro_v2.0.sh
```
The  script  will  prompt  you  to  enter  paths,  report  filename,  and  configuration  options.
